Cordelia’s act of fidelity towards her father reminds me of “21 Savage,” a modern-century poet and singer. In one of the artist’s songs, “ball w/o you,” he emotes the clear distinction between love and loyalty: “It don't take much to love / You can love somebody just by being attached (21) / See loyalty is a action / You can love or hate me and still have my back (Facts).” This directly relates to the relationship Cordelia envisions with King Lear: though she does not emotionally love him, she respects his figure and always has his back.
